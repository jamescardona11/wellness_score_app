/// A use case that calculates a user's financial health status based on their income and expenses.
///
/// The calculation takes into account:
/// * Annual income (before tax)
/// * Monthly costs
/// * Tax rate (currently fixed at 8%)
///
/// The health score is determined by calculating the ratio between annual expenses
/// and net income (after tax):
///
/// * Healthy: Ratio â‰¤ 25% of net income
/// * Medium: Ratio between 25% and 75% of net income
/// * Low: Ratio > 75% of net income
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final healthScore = HealthScoreUseCase(analyticsRepository);
/// final status = healthScore(
///   annualIncome: 100000,
///   monthlyCosts: 2000,
/// );
/// ```
